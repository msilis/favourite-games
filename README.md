# Favourite Games App

Made with React and Express.

## Functionality

Keep a list of games you like. Currently there is no way to add a thumbnail for a newly added game.

Once added you can edit the title or description or delete the game from the list.

## Running

Start the Express server first, there is a nodemon script available. Then start the app itself.

It will come with some hardcoded games in the json file.
